## Cost Analysis

### Supabase Pricing (Free Tier)
- Database: 500MB (sufficient for 1000+ customers)
- File Storage: 50MB
- Bandwidth: 2GB
- Auth: Unlimited users
- **Total: $0/month**

### Scaling Considerations
- Pro plan ($25/month) when you exceed free limits
- Additional storage as needed

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensure customers can only see their own data
2. **API Key Management**: Secure environment variables
3. **Data Backup**: Regular database backups
4. **GDPR Compliance**: Customer data deletion capabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up Supabase project and basic schema
2. **Week 1**: Integrate booking API with database
3. **Week 2**: Build basic admin dashboard
4. **Week 3**: Add customer portal
5. **Week 4**: Implement reporting features

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Scalable**: Can handle hundreds of customers
2. **Cost-effective**: Free tier covers most small businesses
3. **User-friendly**: Supabase dashboard for non-technical users
4. **Future-proof**: Easy to add features like mobile apps
5. **Professional**: Proper CRM functionality for business growth

## Alternative Quick Start

If you want to start immediately with minimal setup:
1. Use Google Sheets as temporary database
2. Integrate with Google Sheets API
3. Build basic admin interface
4. Migrate to Supabase later

This approach gives you immediate functionality while planning the full CRM implementation.
